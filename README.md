AQUA: AI-Powered Maritime Route Optimization
AQUA is a full-stack web application designed to find the most fuel-efficient maritime routes by analyzing real-time environmental data and predicting future sea conditions with a live-trained AI model.
This project addresses the critical challenges of modern shipping: high fuel consumption, significant CO‚ÇÇ emissions, and the operational risks posed by unpredictable weather. By leveraging a sophisticated pathfinding algorithm and a predictive AI, AQUA provides smarter, safer, and more economical routing solutions.

üìΩÔ∏è Live Demo
‚ú® Key Features
Dynamic, Fuel-Efficient Routing: Utilizes a powerful A* pathfinding algorithm to calculate the optimal route based on minimizing fuel consumption, not just distance.
Comprehensive Environmental Analysis: The algorithm considers multiple real-world factors, including wind speed & direction, ocean currents, wave height, sea depth, rainfall, and ice concentration.
Live Voyage Simulation: A real-time boat animation visualizes the journey, complete with a heads-up display (HUD) showing the vessel's progress and the live environmental conditions it encounters.
AI-Powered Weather Prediction: A Genetic Algorithm (GA) is trained live on data collected during the voyage to evolve a predictive model that forecasts sea conditions for the next 6 hours.
Interactive Map Interface: Users can easily set routes, select different vessel types, and monitor all voyage metrics through a clean and intuitive user interface.
Guaranteed Demo Success: Includes a one-click "Demo Route" button for a seamless and impressive presentation experience.

üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack & Architecture
AQUA is built with a modern, multi-service architecture that separates concerns for performance and scalability.


Front-End (Client)
HTML5, Tailwind CSS, JavaScript, Leaflet.js
Renders the interactive map, UI panels, and real-time simulation.

Back-End (Routing API)
Node.js, Express.js
Serves the front-end and runs the core A* pathfinding algorithm.

Data & AI Service
Python, FastAPI, NumPy
Serves large environmental datasets and runs the live GA prediction model.

üöÄ Getting Started
Follow these steps to set up and run the project on your local machine.

Prerequisites
Node.js (v16 or later)
Python (v3.8 or later) with pip
A web browser (Chrome, Firefox, etc.)



1. Download Environmental Data
The application relies on a large set of environmental data files (.nc format). These are essential for the pathfinding algorithm.
Click here to download the nc_data folder from Google Drive
Place the downloaded nc_data folder in the root directory of the project.

2. Set Up the Back-End Services
You will need to run two separate servers in two separate terminals.



Terminal 1: Start the Python Data & AI Service

# Navigate to the project's root directory
cd /path/to/your/project

# Install Python dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Start the FastAPI server
# This will run on [http://127.0.0.1:8000](http://127.0.0.1:8000)
python -m uvicorn data_server:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000



Terminal 2: Start the Node.js Routing Server

# Navigate to the project's root directory in a new terminal
cd /path/to/your/project

# Install Node.js dependencies
npm install

# Start the Express server
# This will run on http://localhost:3000
npm start

3. Launch the Application
Once both servers are running, open your web browser and navigate to:
http://localhost:3000
The Maritime Sea Navigation application should now be fully operational.



üó∫Ô∏è How to Use the App
Set a Route:
Use the search boxes to select a start and end port.
Alternatively, double-click a start point and then an end point directly on the map.
For a quick start, click the "Load Demo Route" button.


Configure Vessel: Select a ship type from the dropdown or enter custom parameters for your vessel. The voyage date will default to today.
Analyze the Route: Once calculated, the optimal path will be displayed on the map, and the sidebar will show key metrics like travel time, distance, and estimated fuel consumption.
Start the Simulation: Click the boat icon control button on the bottom right to begin the real-time voyage animation.
Monitor Live Data: As the boat travels, the HUD on the right will update with live environmental data and the 6-hour forecast from the AI model.



üîÆ Future Development
This project serves as a powerful proof-of-concept. Future enhancements could include:
Pre-Trained AI Models: Training the Genetic Algorithm on years of historical weather data for specific regions to provide highly accurate, long-term forecasts.
Interactive "No-Go" Zones: Allowing users to draw custom zones on the map (e.g., for piracy, military exercises, or protected areas) that the routing algorithm must avoid.
Route Comparison: Offering multiple routing strategies, such as "Fastest," "Safest (Weather Avoidance)," and "Most Fuel-Efficient," and displaying the resulting paths for comparison.
